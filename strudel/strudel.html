        <h2>Ingredients </h2>

        
        <h3>For the Strudel Dough</h3>
    
        <ul class=a>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil</li> 
            <li>10 to 12 tablespoons lukewarm water</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>For the Apple Filling </h3>
        
        <ul class=a>
            <li>14 tablespoons (7 ounces) unsalted butter, divided</li> 
            <li>2 ounces fresh bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (1 3/4 ounces) toasted hazelnuts, finely chopped </li>
            <li>3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, divided</li> 
            <li>1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</li> 
            <li>Pinch salt</li>
            <li>5 large baking apples such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, or Gala (about 2 pounds), peeled, cored, cut into 1/2
                inch cubes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins</li> 
            <li>5 teaspoons juice and 1 teaspoon zest from 1 to 2 lemons</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Make the dough </li>
            <li class=unorder>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stir flour, salt, 3 tablespoons oil, and 10 tablespoons
                        water in a large bowl until almost combined and the mixture
                        looks shaggy. If the mixture appears dry, add more water,
                        one tablespoon at a time. You should have a dough that is
                        soft and tacky, but not sticky.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and gently
                        knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
                        minutes. Form dough into a ball and lightly coat dough with
                        remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil. Place in bowl, lightly cover,
                        and let rest 1 hour. While dough is resting, start the
                        filling.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            

            <li>Make the strudel filling </li>
            <li class=unorder>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat 3 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium-low
                        heat until melted. Add bread crumbs and cook, stirring
                        constantly, until crumbs are moistened and lightly toasted,
                        about 2 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool.</li>
                    <li>Stir 3/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl to
                        combine. Mix in apples, raisins, lemon juice, and zest until
                        just combined. Immediately spoon apple mixture on top of the
                        bread crumbs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            

            <li>Preheat oven</li>
            <li class=unorder>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425°F.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            

            <li>Assemble the strudel</li>
            <li class=unorder>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place a large sheet of parchment paper on your work surface,
                        then cover the table with a large clean cloth. On a lightly
                        floured cutting board, roll dough into a 10- by 12-inch
                        rectangle. Flip the board and the dough onto the center of
                        the cloth and remove board.</li>
                    <li>Working carefully, begin to stretch dough from the center
                        out. This can be achieved by placing your hand, palm down,
                        underneath the dough and gently pulling out to the edge. You
                        can also place your fingertips under the dough to gently
                        stretch. Avoid tearing the dough. If the dough does tear,
                        gently patch together. Stretch the dough until it is a
                        rectangle of approximately 18- by 30-inches and paper
                        thin. The dough should be of even thickness throughout, and
                        thin enough to see through it. Trim off any thick edges with
                        kitchen sheers.</li>
                    <li>Melt remaining butter and brush a thin coat over the dough
                        (extra butter will be used to brush on top of the strudel
                        before baking). Sprinkle chopped hazelnuts over
                        dough. Spread bread crumb mixture in a 12 inch strip at the
                        far end of the dough, leaving a border of 6 to 8 inches from
                        the end and 3 inches from both edges.</li>
                    <li>Using the cloth, lift the end of dough over the strudel to
                        cover. Continue to lift the cloth to roll up the
                        strudel. Halfway through, fold the edges in to seal and
                        continue to roll to the end. The strudel should be
                        approximately 16 to 18 inches long. Roll the strudel
                        directly onto the parchment paper, then lift parchment paper
                        with strudel and transfer to a baking sheet. If the strudel
                        doesn't fit perfect straight onto the pan, gently curve it
                        to fit. Brush with remaining butter and sprinkle with
                        remaining tablespoon sugar.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            
            <li>Bake the strudel</li>
            <li class=unorder>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce oven to 350°F. Continue to
                        bake until strudel is golden and apples are tender, about 30
                        minutes more. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool. Slice
                        and serve with fresh whipped cream or vanilla sauce.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>


        <h2>User Comments </h2>

        <p class=user>The dough is properly thin when you can read a newspaper through
        it, according to the woman at the Strudel Show at Schoenbrun
        Palace (best strudel ever!).</p>

        <p class=user>The backs of your hands should be lightly coated with melted
        butter to prevent the dough sticking to them during
        stretching. (According to my wife who learned this from her
        grandmother who was born in Austria before the Wright bros. flew
        at Kitty Hawk and lived to see Neil Armstrong on the moon!)</p>

        <p class=user>Yum!</p>
